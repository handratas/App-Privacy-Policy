## Chinese Calendar: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Chinese Calendar app for Android!

This is a private project which developed by me Handrata Samsul. the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.INTERNET` | To retrieve all the required data to display auspicious & inauspicious data |

 <hr style="border:1px solid gray">

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Handrata Samsul.
